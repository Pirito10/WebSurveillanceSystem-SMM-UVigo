# Web Surveillance System
_Web Surveillance System_ is a **Video Surveillance Web Application** developed as part of the course "[Servicios Multimedia](https://secretaria.uvigo.gal/docnet-nuevo/guia_docent/?centre=305&ensenyament=V05G301V01&assignatura=V05G301V01401&any_academic=2024_25)" in the Telecommunications Engineering Degree at the Universidad de Vigo (2024 - 2025).

## About The Project
This project integrates a web-based application designed to facilitate the management, processing, and playback of video streams for surveillance purposes. The application incorporates video streaming concepts such as processing the source video with variable parameters, producing an output in a specific format, and playing the video in a web interface, alongside other concepts such as secure user access and database management.

The project features:
- Real-time viewing of video feeds.
- Customizable stream settings such as resolution, codec, bitrate, and framerate.
- Management of multiple video sources simultaneously.
- Secure user access with login functionality.
- Stream recording and downloading in MP4 format.
- Web-based interface.
